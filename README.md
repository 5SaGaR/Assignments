# Steps to run the Agent 

Create a Python virtual environment first after clonining the project (python -m venv venv) then activate venv(name accordingly) (.\venv\Scripts\activate)

Install dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the app by using(python app.py) command 

As the app currently uses cohere API it is a bit slow at inference inference speed can be improved by using any other framework other than Crewai or you can use groq API for faster inference
